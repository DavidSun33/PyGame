# PyGame
All of the code is in Python's PyGame Library. If you want to run code, please download the pygame here.

It should be able to help. 

I do Scratch, C++, and Python. 

Keep in mind that the code is all from the book Making Games with Python & Pygame by Al Sweigart (inventwithpython.com). The code is not mine, and this is all practices from the book itself.

Thank You for reading this README.md file. I appreciate it. Hopefully you did not make your computer explode.
